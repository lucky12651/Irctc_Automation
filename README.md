**Train Booking System using Selenium and Google Cloud Vision API**

This project is a train booking system that automates the process of searching and booking trains on the IRCTC website. The automation is achieved using the Selenium package in Python, which allows us to simulate user interaction with the website. The project also uses the Google Cloud Vision API to solve the captcha displayed during login.

Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the required packages, which you can do by running the following command:


**pip install -r requirements.txt**

You'll also need to set up authentication with the Google Cloud Vision API by obtaining an API key and setting the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to the path of the API key file.

Usage

To use this project, simply run the train_booking_system.py file using the following command:


**python train_booking_system.py**

This will launch the train booking system, which will open the IRCTC website and automate the process of searching and booking trains.
